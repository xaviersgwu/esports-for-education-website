                    <h1>WE ARE GWU ESPORTS</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to our "Esports for Education" website. You may be interested in knowing who the people behind this project are. We are GWU Esports.</p>
                    <p>GWU Esports was originally founded under the name GWU Competitive Gaming and, in 2019, by using the base that was provided to us by our previous management, we rebranded our organization to GWU Esports to focus on all levels of playing, discussing and spectating video games.
                    Our main goal as an organization is to provide a location for GWU students to discuss all topics esports and make new friends.
                    <p> Feel free to join us by joining our Discord server or by tuning in to some streams on our twitch.tv account!</p>
