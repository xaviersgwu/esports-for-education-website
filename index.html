                            The DCSAA (District of Columbia State Athletic Association) is the only officially recognized varsity-level high school esports league in Washington D.C. 
                            This league is a great way for schools to promote character development through esports especially in communication, discipline, self-esteem and sportsmanship through gameplay.

                            GWU Esports is the fastest growing organization within The George Washington University, having gained over 500 members in 2021, and is the home to a massive hub and community for GWU students, alumni and friends to discuss their mutual interest in video games.
                            "Esports for Education" is GWU Esports' most recent and ambitious project which GWU Esports is undertaking.

                <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
                <div class="roadmap-item-wrapper">
                    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                    <h3>Support for communities in Washington, D.C.</h3>
                    <p> Although this project unfortunately isn't a reality yet, we are working our hardest to work with companies that might be interested in supporting us.
                        The goal of this program is to promote playing video games as a positive source for social and personal development. 
                        Most people find video games to be a temporary escape from day-to-day life, however we know that video games are great to work on team building, communication as well as creating lifelong friendships.
                        We also acknowledge that Esports are beginning to be a lot more prevalent in middle and high schools as they gradually shift to involving themselves more and more into programs such as the aforementioned PlayVS and DCSAA for competitive esports.
                        We want to be able to give these kids an opportunity which they might not be able to pursue on their own budget.
                        Helping children in lower-income communities find something that they can be passionate about as they plan to leave high school and move onto higher education is not only formative for them as individuals but can help further a sense of community.
                    <h3>Esports as a positive influence on education</h3>
                    <p> It is known that esports serve as a positive influence across multiple fields in youth development. Here are some of the fields that can be positively affected by esports (provided by <a href="https://www.dcsaasports.org/esports">DCSAA</a>):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> <h3>Character Development: </h3><p> We at GWU Esports can attest that people that play video games develop strongly on their discipline, self-esteem, communication and sportsmanship through practicing and playing with friends or with a team.</p></li>
                            <li> <h3>Increased Participation:</h3><p> Esports are co-ed, inclusive to disabilities and engage students who might not participate in other school athletics or activities.</p></li>
                            <li> <h3>STEM Engagement:</h3><p> Esports players are often more interested in STEM classes and programs than other programs. A high percentage of collegiate esports players select STEM majors.</p></li>
                            <li> <h3>College Scholarships</h3><p> More than 200 colleges and universities offer esports scholarships and are actively recruiting players for their own programs. Not only does this mean that a student could receive scholarships for publicly showcasing their skills but they are given an incentive to perform well in their extra-curriculars!</p></li>
